Thank you for paying attention to the work done here.

Requirements:
Python installed on the system (preferably ver 3.10) with tqdm package installed

WARNING: In some scenarios the game may seem stuck during the transition period between rounds. This error occurs due to the file pyenv.cfg being improperly setup during instalation. To fix this issue simply open the pyen.cfg file , located inside "PythonFiles" and verify that the home variable is pointing to a directory where python is installed.
 


Issues noted on the current version of game:

Some issues may occur during tower placement when the game is full-screen 

Upgrade icons for certain towers may clip out of frame if towers are placed too clos to the edge
